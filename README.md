# CPU-temperature-checker
Basic program that runs a wmic command-based script to get information about the CPU(Windows only).
The wmic command that I'm using returns the cpu temperature in tenths of a kelvin, so i just used some basic arithmetic to get the result in celcius.
Program is run as a .exe file.
